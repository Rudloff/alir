You can write notes, save articles from their URL or by sharing them from the browser. You can also subscribe to news feeds. You can use Àlir on a desktop computer, a tablet, a phone… and keep all your devices in sync. For example, you can save an article on your computer and read it later on your phone.\

  The top left menu allow to delete the current article, archive it, add tags…\
  \
  You can also annotate every paragraph by right clicking (on desktop computer) or with a long press on tactiles devices.\
  \
  The scrollbar on the left is also a menu. Click on it to add news articles, access settings and manage feeds subscription.\
